# Make your own video NSPs

## Part 1 - Files

Needed:

HomebrewWebFramework (find it on this discord: https://discord.gg/NrM75Wf )

Your .mp4 (important!) video file

Your preferred Image to BMP website or app
I use https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-bmp or Paint (windows)

Optional: 

Handbreak https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php (if your movie is 1080p)

## Part 2 - Tutorial

find the video(s) you want to install
find an icon
convert the icon image to 1024x1024 BMP HAS TO BE THE EXACT SIZE!
open the HomebrewWebFramework
Find or make up a title id
you can edit some from this site http://nswdb.com/
download https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498194126752448523/501365662854152202/index.html
edit the HTML with the name of your movie like m.mp4 
save it
put the index.html and your mp4 in the same folder 
load the folder into HomebrewWebFramework
input a title id
input the name of the nsp you will see on home menu
input nintendo into author
input 1.0 into version
load your bmp icon.
you should check ask for user and screenshots.
build the NSP.
copy it to your switch
install it with DevMenu, tinfoil or n1dus.

## Info 1 - Bugs and Issues

sometimes the framework will crash without making the nsp. if that happens you need a new image for the icon.
If you hold the home button during a video it can lock up!
if you hit b on the index page you will need to restart the app
don't hit x either.

## Info 2 - Handbreak Tutorial

if the mp4 is 1080p or higher. load it into handbreak
and set it to web ready. 720p audio 256kbps and encode it
